Hamas praised President Trump for his work in securing a deal to end the war in Gaza, touting the US leader as a figure that will help lead the Palestinian enclave to prosperity.
The terror group lauded “the efforts of US President Donald Trump aimed at definitively stopping the war and the complete withdrawal of the occupation from the Gaza Strip.”
The agreement calls for an immediate cease-fire, the release of all 48 Israeli hostages, a staged withdrawal of the Israeli army from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas, and the creation of a transitional government spearheaded by an international body.
As part of the hostage exchange, Israel would release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, with Hamas also calling on Trump to make sure the Jewish state keeps up its end of the bargain.
The group said that under Trump’s deal, Gaza would be able to achieve peace and be on its way to achieve “independence and self-determination.”Both Hamas and Israel accepted the terms of the deal on Wednesday night, with Trump announcing that the hostages would likely be released next Monday. 
“This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
“All Parties will be treated fairly!” the president added, calling it “a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed the praise, calling it a “great day for Israel” as his government convenes to push the deal through the Knesset on Thursday.  
“With the help of the Almighty, together we will continue to achieve all our goals and expand peace with our neighbors,” Netanyahu wrote on X.
